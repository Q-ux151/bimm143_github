Today we are exploring the **ggplot** package and how to make nice figures in R. 

There are lots of ways to make figures and plots in R. These include:

- so called "base" R 
- and add on packages like **ggplot**

Below is a simple "base" R plot:

```{r}
head(cars)
```

We can simply pass this do the `plot()` function.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

>key-point: Base R is quick but not so nice-looking in some folks' eyes.

Now we are gonna make this plot with **ggplot2**

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cars)
```
